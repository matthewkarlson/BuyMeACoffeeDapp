# Matthew Karlson Week 2 Road to web 3  Project

A simple "buy me a coffee" DApp which allows user to connect their wallets and send small amounts of to the contract.
The owner of the contract is able to decide which addresses are able to withdraw from the contract,
Users have the option of choosing how many coffees to buy, the instruction was to add functionality to buy a large coffee but I wanted to challenge myself and allow users to specify exactly how much eth (or how many coffees) they want to donate!
